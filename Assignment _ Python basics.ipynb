    "# THEORY QUESTION ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
    ":- Python is a easy to use for data analysis and also versatile, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use, making it an applications, including web development, data science, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
    ":- Interpreters are the computer program that will convert the source code and program that reads and executes python code and other programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
    ":- Python have some predefine and reserved keywords they are used to define the syntax of coding .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
    ":- No, because keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings used for languages syntax and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
    ":- Mutable data types are those whose values can be changed . such as lists and dictionaries, allow you to change their value or data directly without affecting their identity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
    ":- List are mutable because they are changable or modified in coding after creating and tuples are immutable because they are non-changable or not modified after creating .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
    ":-  The '==' is known as the equality operator. The 'is' is known as the identity operator. Basics, The == operator helps us compare the equality of objects. The \"is\" operator is a positive equivalence checking operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
    ":- Logical operators in Python combine two or more operands and conduct logical comparisons on them . There are three types of logics \"AND\" , \"OR\" , \"NOT\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
    ":- Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another data type .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ? \n",
    ":-  Implicit type conversion is performed by a Python interpreter only. Explicit type conversion is performed by the user by explicitly using type conversion functions in the program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
    ":- Conditional statements (if, else if, and else) in programming allow you to control the flow of execution based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling your code to make decisions and perform different actions accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12.  How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    ":-  elif is short for \"else if\" and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?  \n",
    ":- The difference between for loop and while loop is that for allows initialization, condition checking and iteration statements on the top of the loop, whereas while only allows initialization and condition checking at the top of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ? \n",
    ":- Prefer a while loop when the condition has nothing to do with a collection/array and does not require a set number of iterations. Prefer a foreach or a for loop whenever the loop is related to a collection or array.\n",
    "\n"
